# Academic Projects!

I earned a [*Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation*](https://www.digipen.edu/academics/game-design-and-development-degrees/bs-in-computer-science-in-real-time-interactive-simulation). I know, a mouth-full.

Throughout my time at DigiPen, I've taken on a traditional Computer Science curriculum with the addition
of game programming techniques and [computer graphics](https://github.com/Kaylubkiss/Project-Samples/tree/main/Academic%20Projects/Graphics). 

Go ahead, take a look! I've additionally tagged the course(s) the code was written for in the folder names.
