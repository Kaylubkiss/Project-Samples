# Custom Engine!

I started this project for a few reasons:
- My persistent interest in programming graphics
- A recommendation from a contact at NVidia
- Agency over my code, and needing to learn how to create useful systems in a custom environment 

# [Core](https://github.com/Kaylubkiss/Project-Samples/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Unnamed%20Vulkan%20Engine/Core)
Files that handle I/O and game-specific logic.

# [Graphics](https://github.com/Kaylubkiss/Project-Samples/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Unnamed%20Vulkan%20Engine/Graphics)
Files that handle Vulkan-specific logic and [shader](https://github.com/Kaylubkiss/Project-Samples/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Unnamed%20Vulkan%20Engine/Graphics/shaders) files.
